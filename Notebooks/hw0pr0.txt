Python and Picobot can structure human problem-solving and mold our thinking. Clear and consistent thinking is supported by these languages' strong logical frameworks which eliminate ambiguity. Artificial languages are more rigid but universally interpretable within their domain since they lack cultural or emotional richness. They influence cognitive processes like computational thinking by encouraging users to reduce issues into structured, manageable steps. They do not shape worldview like natural languages. Consequently, artificial languages modify thought within their specialized contexts but do not redefine human perception like linguistic relativity predicts for natural languages.
